            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 (9 inch) prepared graham cracker dust</li>

        <br/>
        <h3>Pumpkin Layer</h3>

        <br/>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make cheesecake layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. 
                Add eggs, one at a time, blending well after each addition. Spread 1 cup batter in the graham cracker crust.</li>
            <li>Make pumpkin layer: Add pumpkin puree, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg to the remaining batter; stir gently until well blended.
                Carefully spread on top of plain cheesecake batter in the crust.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are puffed and the surface is firm except for
                a small spot in the center that jiggled when the pan is gently shaken, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, set on a wire rack, and cool to room temperature, 1 to 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate for at least 3 hours before serving, preferably overnight.</li>
